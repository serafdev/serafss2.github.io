### Codewars

You can find the solutions here: [codewars solutions/fails](https://github.com/serafss2/codewars_python). 

I suggest everyone that wants to learn programming and/or to keep practicing to do the same (code challenges etc). I remember when I was doing my Data structures course I didn't understand much of what was happening, so I decided to implement every sorting algorithm and data structure by only looking at the wiki page, and then from memory, I had to do the process at least 10 times for each of them until it sticks in my brain.
