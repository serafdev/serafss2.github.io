### Utterances Integration 

So I came across a pretty cool open source project that let's you use github issues to integrate commenting to your blogposts.

Adding to this other pretty cool open source jekyll project that I use as a theme, the combination to me is the best, I have no code to write, no servers to take care of and I have my blog running just like that.

For more information here is the link: https://utteranc.es/

For the blog code/theme I use: https://github.com/johno/pixyll/

Both documentations are very straight forward, I decided to integrate both together, so probably by the time you read this you won't need to do the integration yourself, but basically it's in this commit if you want to cherry-pick: https://github.com/serafss2/serafss2.github.io/commit/5f26b226c531e67c7f865bfffeebbb1f7ab93adb

Also, give it a try just bellow!
