### Summary

Passionate Developer offering experience in Back-End Development to deliver highly scalable products. Highly organized and have a good sense of architectural planning. Extensive experience in the full cycle of the software design process including requirements definition, prototyping, proof of concept, design, interface implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance and all the blablabla that you end up googling anyway.

----------------------------

### Technical tools

Python, Scala, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud environment, Linux, etc

---------------------------


###  Professional experience 
#### Desjardins (Jan 2019 - Present)
Analyst Programmer (Backend, Network Automation / Python, Django, Docker)

Automating network stuff like creating LTM Virtual Servers, IP addresses manipulation (reserve/free/modify), something with CISCO routers, etc. I'll update this when I'll have the right vocabulary, I still have to read my notes while I code.

#### Faimdata (Dec 2016 - Dec 2018)
Software Engineer (Back-end, DevOps / Scala, Python, BigQuery, Postgresql, Docker, Kubernetes)
 
Worked as a Backend developer using Scala, Python and BigQuery to build a highly scalable CI tool in a data environment. Moved the legacy network architecture from manual deployments to Nginx, Docker and Kubernetes with continuous integration and delivery with Jenkins, saved the developers a * ton of time. Built a Micro-Queries library that took care of reccurent logic in our Data Scientist's Queries, it helped the performance of APIs from >1min to <10 seconds, also added a Memcached server to our APIs which enhanced most requests to <.2second, pretty satisfying if you ask me.

---------------------------

### Education
#### Université de Montréal
Computer Science Major

A lot of algorithmics, data structures, software engineering, mathematics, statistics, etc. Same as everyone else
